Our innovation, GlaucoSolve Glasses is a non-invasive, wearable, cost-effective, and remote monitoring solution that uses ultrasound transducers, receivers, and Arduino modules to monitor IOP. By applying acoustic force to the cornea and analyzing the reflected signal, we can compute various ultrasound parameters and correlate them to get the patientâ€™s eye pressure.
