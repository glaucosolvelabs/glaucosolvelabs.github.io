          <p>Hello, we are GlaucoSolve, a team of high school students passionate about bioengineering and entrepreneurship. </p>
          <p><br/>Vision serves as the connective thread weaving our life experiences together, enabling us to cherish special moments with one another. We believe vision is like a candle that burns bright for humanity; vision is one of the simplest, yet greatest sources of joy in the world. Sadly, glaucoma snuffs out that joy, devastating over 80 million people worldwide.</p>
          <p><br/> Among the most commonly employed treatments for glaucoma are eye drops containing beta-blockers to reduce IOP in patients. However, their effectiveness is limited by the inability to predict when patients will experience IOP spikes, which can spike 110% beyond normal levels in a matter of minutes at any time of day without one's awareness. As a result, 15-20% of glaucoma patients following these prescription eye drop treatment plans still become completely blind in one eye within 10 years of diagnosis (Susanna et al., 2015). Because intraocular pressure (IOP) monitors are only accessible during hospital appointments, patients are kept in the dark of when to apply their eye drops to reduce their IOP. Furthermore, physicians can only determine if a treatment is ineffective months after being prescribed, but by then, the patient's eyesight would have already permanently declined. Thus, there is a pressing, unmet need for a continuous, non-invasive, affordable, and user-operated IOP monitor.</p>
